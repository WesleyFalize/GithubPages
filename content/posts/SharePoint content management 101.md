## What will you get out of this series?
This series is intended to increase my depth and breadth of understanding for content management within SharePoint. During the years I've been working with SharePoint i started without a solid foundation on this subject, I've learned on the go and by requirements during projects. During this series i want to go over the basics of content management and from there on dive deeper into the nooks and crannies of content management. During this post we will go over the foundational elements and in additional posts we will dive into detail in these topics

## Content management foundation
The foundation of content management within SharePoint is surprisingly the content. This content can be defined on multiple levels but for the simplicity of getting started we define it as a file or item. A file is a Word or Excel file and an Item is usually a list item like a travel request. SharePoint offers a few core components to manage content
- Version history
- Recycle bin
- Metadata
- Workflows
- Collaboration
