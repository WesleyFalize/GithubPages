## What is a Microsoft 365 group
A Microsoft 365 group is a modern approach to access management with Microsoft 365. A Microsoft 365 has evolved over the use within Microsoft 365. Initially a Microsoft 365 was defined as a "Unified group" originating in Exchange. Granting the functionality of a distribution group with more functions like archival and a opt-in function. In the modern architecture a Microsoft 365 is the glue of collaboration. A Microsoft 365 group can now be connected to Teams, Viva Engage, Planner. By default it is always connected to SharePoint and Outlook, the other linked resources are option.
## Microsoft 365 group governance

### Public vs private Microsoft 365 groups
Public Microsoft 365 groups are visible to everyone in the organization and allow any member to join, while private Microsoft 365 groups require an invitation to join and are only visible to members. It is important for organizations to establish clear governance guidelines on when to use public vs private groups to ensure proper access control and collaboration.

### Static vs dynamic membership
A Microsoft 365 membership can be both static and dynamic. A dynamic group doesn't require administration to add and remove members. Based on Entra ID attributes the membership will be arranged. A static group requires the adding of members on an individual basis

### Group administration delegation
Microsoft 365 group management is delegated to the group owners by default. These group owners have the permission to add and remove members within the group. This reduces the burden on the IT department to conduct group management. 

### Group naming conventions
Establishing group naming conventions is essential for maintaining a clear and organized structure within Microsoft 365 groups. By implementing consistent naming conventions, organizations can easily identify and manage groups, reducing confusion and improving overall efficiency.
### Group expiration policies
Implementing group expiration policies can help organizations manage the lifecycle of Microsoft 365 groups. By setting expiration dates for groups, organizations can ensure that outdated or unused groups are automatically archived or deleted, reducing clutter and improving security.

## Creation of Microsoft 365 groups
A Microsoft 365 group can originate from multiple sources like SharePoint, Teams, Planner, Outlook and Viva but in the end they are always an object in Entra ID, with owners and members in the group granting access to certain resources.
